In this project, I have practiced anomaly detection using different Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor(LOF), One-Class Support Vector Machine and Elliptic Envelope.
Anomaly detection is a data mining technique used to identify patterns, events, or observations that deviate significantly from the norm.
